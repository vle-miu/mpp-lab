The reason is that the hashcode() method in Employee haven't overrided yet.
So it cannot remove duplicate value in method removeDuplicates()

Solution - Override hascode() method in Employee like this:

    @Override
	public boolean equals(Object ob) {
		if(ob == null) return false;
		if(!(ob instanceof Employee)) return false;
		Employee emp = (Employee)ob;
		return emp.name.equals(name) && emp.salary == salary;
	}
